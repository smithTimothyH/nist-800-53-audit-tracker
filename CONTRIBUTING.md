- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types

### File Organization

- Place components in appropriate directories
- Use descriptive file names
- Keep related files together
- Follow the existing project structure

### Styling

- Follow the design system
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on different screen sizes

### Code Formatting

- Use ESLint and follow the existing configuration
- Format code consistently
- Use meaningful comments
- Remove console.log statements before committing

## üé® Design Guidelines

### UI/UX Principles

- **Consistency**: Follow the established design patterns
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible
- **Responsiveness**: Design for all screen sizes

- Follow the typography scale
- Ensure proper line heights and spacing

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

- Test all new features thoroughly
- Verify existing functionality still works
- Test on different browsers and devices
- Check accessibility with screen readers

### User Roles Testing

Test with different user roles:
- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Contributor**: Can edit controls and evidence
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document component props and interfaces
- Explain business logic and algorithms
- Keep comments up to date

### User Documentation

- Update the user guide for new features
- Add screenshots for visual features
- Provide clear step-by-step instructions
- Include troubleshooting information

## üöÄ Feature Development

### Planning

- Discuss major features in issues first
- Consider the impact on existing functionality
- Plan for different user roles and permissions
- Think about scalability and performance

### Implementation

- Break large features into smaller commits
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Consider edge cases and error handling

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs
- Follow security best practices
- Consider data privacy implications
- Test for common vulnerabilities

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Investigation

- Reproduce the bug consistently
- Identify the root cause
- Consider the impact on other features
- Document your findings

### Resolution

- Fix the root cause, not just symptoms
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Ensure no regression in other features
- Update tests if necessary
